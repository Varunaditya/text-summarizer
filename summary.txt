He said Ofo educates its riders on correct parking, and that employees make sure bikes are evenly distributed, kept in good repair and out of the public’s way. Zagster’s Pace bikes are equipped with built-in cables to lock to fixed objects, which has allowed the Massachusetts-based firm to have 250 bikes, the maximum allowed under the pilot program, while Ofo and LimeBike are currently limited to 50 bikes each because they lack lock-to technology. The city’s new dockless bike share program mandates that rental bikes be capable of being locked to some physical object — like a bike rack or signpost — by July 1. Dockless bikes allow users to locate bikes to rent through a phone app, instead of getting them from a bike station, as required by the city-owned Divvy program. LimeBike electric-assist bikes costs $1 to unlock, and 15 cents per minute. But China-based Ofo and California-based LimeBike, which use wheel locks rather than cables or U-locks to secure bikes between rentals, say they hope to change the city’s mind on the “lock-to” requirement in the next two months. In some other cities, dockless bikes have posed problems and cluttered sidewalks when parked carelessly. This will fill a bike share desert, as there are no Divvy stations south of 87th Street. He said bikes not locked to fixed objects like bike racks can become a “public nuisance.”
