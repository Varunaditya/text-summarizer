Zagster’s Pace bikes are equipped with built-in cables to lock to fixed objects, which has allowed the Massachusetts-based firm to have 250 bikes, the maximum allowed under the pilot program, while Ofo and LimeBike are currently limited to 50 bikes each because they lack lock-to technology. The city’s six-month pilot program will run from 79th to 138th streets and from the Skyway west to Pulaski Road.
